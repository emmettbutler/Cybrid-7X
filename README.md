This small game was made over the course of one week in February 2013 in collaboration with Nina Freeman (@hentaiphd) and Diego Garcia (@radstronomical). We entered it in the Playstation Mobile game jam at the first Indiecade East.

The theme of the game jam was "evolution", and this game allows the player to build a family tree of flowers, exploring different genetic strains in the process. Plants that are near each other will produce offspring that share the traits of its parents. The player can trigger this reproduction by watering the plants.

The game's goal is to navigate the evolutionary tree to find the specific mutation indicated by the screen in the top right corner. The player cannot move through plants, so she must avoid blocking herself off from the goal area.

This game compiles for and runs on the Playstation Vita system, and is written using the Playstation Mobile SDK in C#.
